<p>Research on progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is an important area of astrophysics since the properties of SNe Ia are well understood, but the details of the mechanisms that produce them are not. SNe Ia data led to the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe, giving rise to theories of dark energy and dark matter, and has even suggested that Einstein's general relativistic model of gravity might need modification.
</p>
<p>Several scenarios could possibly lead to SNe Ia, but my research focuses on the doubly degenerate model, which is a binary star system with two white dwarfs (WDs) that are in orbit around each other. As the WDs orbit one another, they radiate energy in the form of gravitational waves and gradually begin to merge with each other. These orbits are elliptical, but in my simulations I assume a circular orbit. Masses of WDs are comparable to that of our own sun, but most tend to have masses of around 0.6-0.7 solar masses. In addition to having varying masses, WDs also have different chemical profiles. In order to simulate mergers, I build WDs with different masses in the range of about 0.5-1.0 solar masses and chemical profiles that are appropriate for each mass value. Initially, these WDs are composed primarily of helium-4, carbon-12, and oxygen-16. Previous research does not take into account the effects of chemical abundances in triggering SNe Ia, and I have modified the existing smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code ChaNGa (<a href="https://github.com/mbrins462/ChaNGa">ChaNGa repository</a>) to incorporate the nuclear fusion that might be triggered during the merger process if the temperature reaches high enough levels. If nuclear fusion is triggered, then this could raise temperatures even higher and produce a SN Ia. 
</p>
<p>SPH simulations are an invaluable tool in performing fluid dynamics simulations. They allow a complicated fluid dynamics problem to be treated as a much simpler particle dynamics problem. Each of the particles in the simulation has physical properties associated with it such as mass, density, or temperature, and from the individual particle properties we can interpolate the value of the smoothed field for any of these properties. So even though there are regions of space that do not have any particles, we can still compute a value of temperature, for example, in those regions. The next two images demonstrate this concept. These plots are of a merger between two 0.583 solar mass WDs fairly late in the merger process (nearly spherical symmetry). This simulation used approximately 500k particles in total. The first plot is just a scatter plot of all of the particles located in a thin slice on the xy-plane. The color of each particle represents the mass fraction of neon-20 that the particle contains, and we can see that there is very little neon in the system. The second plot shows the smoothed fields for density, temperature, and neon-20. What little neon has been produced by fusion in this simulation is located above and below the orbital plane. The three images on the left hand column of the second plot are slices in the xy-plane, while the right hand column are in the xz-plane. Each window is 3e9 centimeters to a side.

<p><a href="http://nanograv.org">NANOGrav</a> is one of several scientific collaborations across the globe that uses pulsar timing arrays in order to detect gravitational waves. Pulsars are like interstellar lighthouses, each emitting signals at regular intervals, and we can predict when each pulse should arrive at the Earth. By taking the difference between the expected time-of-arrival (TOA) and the actual TOA, we obtain residuals for each measurement. These residuals can be used to detect gravitational waves, since a passing gravitational wave will stretch and compress spacetime between the Earth and the pulsar. This varyation in spacetime contributes to earlier- or later-than-expected TOAs for the pulses. The sensitive frequency range is in the nanohertz regime (thus NANOGrav). To put it another way, these gravitational waves have periods of oscillation on the order of years to tens of years.</p>
<p>I am currently performing data analysis on the 9yr data set using Bayesian analysis tools written by members of NANOGrav, in a search for continuous gravitational waves. Sources of these signals are super massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). As galaxies merge, the super massive black holes at their centers find each other due to their gravitational interaction, and begin to orbit one another. As the SMBHBs orbit each other they will emit a continuous gravitational wave signal, and it is these signals that we are looking for in the timing residuals.</p>
