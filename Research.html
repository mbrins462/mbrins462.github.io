<p>Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) are important cosmological tools and are well known, but the mechanisms that produce them are still unclear. There are several scenarios that could be possible progenitors of SNeIa, and my research examines cases of doubly-degenerate white dwarf mergers. These are just binary star systems in which both of the stars are white dwarfs. As the white dwarfs orbit each other, they emit gravitational waves radiating energy in the process. The energy loss brings the stars closer to each other until they begin to merge.</p>

<p>A white dwarf is a star that is at the end of its life. Before becoming a white dwarf, the star was able to counteract gravitational self-collapse by the thermal energy produced by nuclear fusion. This is known as hydrostatic equilibrium. As the star nears the end of its life, it cannot support hydrostatic equilibrium and gravity takes over. Once gravity takes over, the mass of the star determines its ultimate fate. If a star is roughly the same mass as our sun, it will end up as a white dwarf. This is due to electron degerneracy pressure and is a result of the Pauli exclusion principle. In this case, gravity can only compress matter so much before the electrons push back. If the star has a higher mass, then electron degeneracy pressure can be overcome by gravity and produce a neutron star. For even greater masses, there is nothing that can stop gravity and a black hole is born.</p>

<p><a href="http://nanograv.org">NANOGrav</a> is one of several scientific collaborations across the globe that uses pulsar timing arrays in order to detect gravitational waves. Pulsars are like interstellar lighthouses, each emitting signals at regular intervals, and we can predict when each pulse should arrive at the Earth. By taking the difference between the expected time-of-arrival (TOA) and the actual TOA, we obtain residuals for each measurement. These residuals can be used to detect gravitational waves, since a passing gravitational wave will stretch and compress spacetime between the Earth and the pulsar. This varyation in spacetime contributes to earlier- or later-than-expected TOAs for the pulses. The sensitive frequency range is in the nanohertz regime (thus NANOGrav). To put it another way, these gravitational waves have periods of oscillation on the order of years to tens of years.</p>
<p>I am currently performing data analysis on the 9yr data set using Bayesian analysis tools written by members of NANOGrav, in a search for continuous gravitational waves. Sources of these signals are super massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). As galaxies merge, the super massive black holes at their centers find each other due to their gravitational interaction, and begin to orbit one another. As the SMBHBs orbit each other they will emit a continuous gravitational wave signal, and it is these signals that we are looking for in the timing residuals.</p>
