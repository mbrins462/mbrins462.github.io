<p>Research on progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is an important area of astrophysics since the properties of SNe Ia are well understood, but the details of the mechanisms that produce them are not. SNe Ia data led to the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe, giving rise to theories of dark energy and dark matter, and has even suggested that Einstein's general relativistic model of gravity might need modification.
</p>
<p>Several scenarios could possibly lead to SNe Ia, but my research focuses on the doubly degenerate model, which is a binary star system with two white dwarfs (WDs) that are in orbit around each other. As the WDs orbit one another, they radiate energy in the form of gravitational waves and gradually begin to merge with each other. These orbits are elliptical, but in my simulations I assume a circular orbit. Masses of WDs are comparable to that of our own sun, but most tend to have masses of around 0.6-0.7 solar masses. In addition to having varying masses, WDs also have different chemical profiles. In order to simulate mergers, I build WDs with different masses in the range of about 0.5-1.0 solar masses and chemical profiles that are appropriate for each mass value. Initially, these WDs are composed primarily of helium-4, carbon-12, and oxygen-16. Previous research does not take into account the effects of chemical abundances in triggering SNe Ia, and I have modified the existing smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code ChaNGa (<a href="https://github.com/mbrins462/ChaNGa">ChaNGa repository</a>) to incorporate the nuclear fusion that might be triggered during the merger process if the temperature reaches high enough levels. If nuclear fusion is triggered, then this could raise temperatures even higher and produce a SN Ia. 
</p>
<p>SPH simulations are an invaluable tool in performing fluid dynamics simulations. They allow a complicated fluid dynamics problem to be treated as a much simpler particle dynamics problem. Each of the particles in the simulation has physical properties associated with it such as mass, density, or temperature, and from the individual particle properties we can interpolate the value of the smoothed field for any of these properties. So even though there are regions of space that do not have any particles, we can still compute a value of temperature, for example, in those regions. The next two images demonstrate this concept. These plots are of a merger between two 0.583 solar mass WDs fairly late in the merger process (nearly spherical symmetry). This simulation used approximately 500k particles in total (I found that 500k particles was a good balance between maximizing resolution and minimizing computational costs). The first plot is just a scatter plot of all of the particles located in a thin slice on the xy-plane. The color of each particle represents the mass fraction of neon-20 that the particle contains, and we can see that there is very little neon in the system. The second plot shows the smoothed fields for density, temperature, and neon-20. What little neon has been produced by fusion in this simulation is located above and below the orbital plane. The three images on the left hand column of the second plot are slices in the xy-plane, while the right hand column are in the yz-plane. Each window is 3e9 centimeters to a side.

<p>To demonstrate the effects of nuclear fusion in my models, look at the next two images. These are both slice plots in the xy-plane and the yz-plane (left column and right column respectively) showing the smoothed fields for density, temperature, and neon-20 mass fraction. The dimensions for each window is 3e9 centimeters on each side. These simulations are both for a 0.651 solar mass accretor WD and a 0.610 solar mass donor WD using approximately 500k particles. The difference between the two is that the first plot is run without my nuclear fusion model, and the second plot includes nuclear fusion. Both models are similar, except that in the burning model there appear some high temperature pockets at certain locations that indicate that the nuclear fusion process (in this case helium-4 and oxygen-16 are fusing to produce neon-20) is releasing additional thermal energy into the system.

<p><a href="http://nanograv.org">NANOGrav</a> is one of several scientific collaborations across the globe that uses pulsar timing arrays in order to detect gravitational waves. Pulsars are like interstellar lighthouses, each emitting signals at regular intervals, and we can predict when each pulse should arrive at the Earth. By taking the difference between the expected time-of-arrival (TOA) and the actual TOA, we obtain residuals for each measurement. These residuals can be used to detect gravitational waves, since a passing gravitational wave will stretch and compress spacetime between the Earth and the pulsar. This varyation in spacetime contributes to earlier- or later-than-expected TOAs for the pulses. The sensitive frequency range is in the nanohertz regime (thus NANOGrav). To put it another way, these gravitational waves have periods of oscillation on the order of years to tens of years.</p>
<p>In my work on data analysis, I analyzed the NANOGrav 9yr data set. The data consist of observations of 37 (17 in the 5yr data set) millisecond pulsars (MSPs) spanning a 9yr observation from 2004 to 2013. All data obtained for the 5yr data set were reprocessed along with the data obtained since then. Each MSP was observed using either the 305m William E. Gordon Telescope of the Aricebo Observatory or with the 100m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescoope (GBT) of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, with the exception of J1713+0747 and B1937+21 which were observed with both telescopes. Observations of these pulsars occured typically at monthly intervals with observation durations of about a half of an hour. 
</p>
<p>These raw pulse profiles must be processed into usable pulse times of arrival (TOAs). The <a href="http://psrchive.sourceforge.net">PSRCHIVE</a> software package was used for this process which is available online in addition to a <a href="http://github.com/demorest/nanopipe">processing pipeline (github.com/demorest/nanopipe)</a> comprised of several scripts.
</p> 
<p>All TOA data used for this paper have been made publicly available on the NANOGrav website.
