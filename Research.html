<p><strong>Background</strong><br/>
Type Ia supernovae are important tools in cosmology whose properties are well known, but the mechanisms leading to them are a subject of current research. Several astrophysical scenarios are possible progenitors of type Ia supernovae, but the scenario that I examine in my research is that of the doubly degerate system. This is a binary system in which both of the stars are white dwarfs. I use the ChaNGa smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code to simulate the mergers of white dwarfs of differing masses and elemental compositions to understand the possible mechanisms that could lead to a supernova. Previous research in this field does not include nuclear fusion in their simulations, and part of my research has been to incorporate nuclear burning into existing software. Including nuclear burning in my models has led to simulations that result in higher temperatures in some areas of the mergers which could trigger an explosion.
</p>
<p>White dwarfs are stars at the ends of their lifetimes that are about as massive as our sun. They are no longer able to produce the thermal energy through nuclear fusion that is necessary to be in hydrostatic equilibrium and without this thermal pressure, gravity begins to collapse the star. However, these stars are not massive enough to collapse into neutron stars or black holes. Instead, they are supported against gravity by electron degeneracy pressure.
</p>
<p>In doubly degenerate systems, the masses of the two white dwarfs are not necessarily equal to one another. Whichever is more massive is called the accretor star, and the less massive one is called the donor star. As the orbital radius between the two begins to decrease, due to radiating energy in the form of gravitational waves, mass from the donor star will begin to fall onto the accretor. As the donor material crashes into the accretor, temperatures can rise and possibly get hot enough to trigger an explosion. By including nuclear burning in my models, these temperatures have the potential to rise even higher since once burning starts it releases more thermal energy.

<p><a href="http://nanograv.org">NANOGrav</a> is one of several scientific collaborations across the globe that uses pulsar timing arrays in order to detect gravitational waves. Pulsars are like interstellar lighthouses, each emitting signals at regular intervals, and we can predict when each pulse should arrive at the Earth. By taking the difference between the expected time-of-arrival (TOA) and the actual TOA, we obtain residuals for each measurement. These residuals can be used to detect gravitational waves, since a passing gravitational wave will stretch and compress spacetime between the Earth and the pulsar. This varyation in spacetime contributes to earlier- or later-than-expected TOAs for the pulses. The sensitive frequency range is in the nanohertz regime (thus NANOGrav). To put it another way, these gravitational waves have periods of oscillation on the order of years to tens of years.</p>
<p>I am currently performing data analysis on the 9yr data set using Bayesian analysis tools written by members of NANOGrav, in a search for continuous gravitational waves. Sources of these signals are super massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). As galaxies merge, the super massive black holes at their centers find each other due to their gravitational interaction, and begin to orbit one another. As the SMBHBs orbit each other they will emit a continuous gravitational wave signal, and it is these signals that we are looking for in the timing residuals.</p>
